# Simon Game

This is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon memory game. The game tests your memory by displaying a sequence of colors that the player must repeat by clicking the corresponding color buttons. As the game progresses, the sequence becomes longer, making it more challenging. The game ends when the player clicks an incorrect color and the sequence resets. 

## Features:

## How to Play:
1. Press any key to start the game.
2. Watch the sequence of colors light up.
